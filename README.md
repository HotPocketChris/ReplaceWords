# ReplaceWords
This is a simple chrome extension that searches and replaces words on a website. Input a word you want 
to search for and another word that will replaces it. This will replace all occuring words on the
website. Mostly working but may still have some bugs. I will further optimize this extension 
with more functionality (highlight words while typing) and become more user friendly (search words while
typing, icons, etc.). 

This was created as a fun little side project to get me familiar with some Javascript, HTML, 
and how chrome extensions work. It also can be used to change someone's Cs to As in their 
grade transcript.
